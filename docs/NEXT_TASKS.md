# Next tasks (backlog)

Recorded work that is decided but not yet built. Each entry says what is
wrong today, what the published source says, and what done looks like.

## Section-level prerequisite notes that narrow the published prerequisite

Found in the Task 1 science-sequence audit (2026-10-27). CoursePilot reads a
course-level OR-list note that narrows `preReqNotes` (parser 4,
`prerequisite_lists`; e.g. 01:160:171). It does **not** read the same kind of
statement when Rutgers prints it in a SECTION note, so these courses are
currently judged on the broader published prerequisite:

| Course | Published prerequisite (`preReqNotes`) | Section note (Spring 2027 SOC) | Effect today |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01:160:160 | 01:160:159 or 161 or 163 or 165 | "PREREQ: 160:159 OR 161" | 163 and 165 are accepted although the sections name only 159/161 - eligibility too broad |
| 01:160:162 | 01:160:159/161/163/165, 21:160:115, 50:160:115 | "GRADE OF C OR BETTER IN 160:161" | the C minimum on 160:161 is not applied - a D in 161 counts |

Done means:

- section-level narrowing OR-lists are enforced like course-level ones, only
  when every course they name is inside the published prerequisite;
- a section-level minimum grade ("C OR BETTER IN <course>") is applied with
  the existing `named` minimum-grade scope;
- a note published on only SOME sections is handled the way corequisites are:
  the course is NEEDS CONFIRMATION, never silently satisfied;
- `scripts/reparse_conditions.py` reports the semantic changes (dry run first,
  backup before applying), and tests cover both courses.

## Major courses per term as a student setting

Raised by the owner's Spring 2027 preview (2026-10-27). The planner fills
each term as anchors -> multi-requirement courses -> ONE dedicated major
course -> fillers, and has no "N major courses per term" setting. If a range
(e.g. 2-3) is wanted, it needs a `PlanningConstraints` field, a place in the
fill order, and tests; it is not a preview option today.
